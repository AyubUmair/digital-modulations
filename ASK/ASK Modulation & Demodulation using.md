# **ASK Modulation \& Demodulation using GNU RadioðŸ“¡**





**This GNU Radio project demonstrates the Amplitude Shift Keying (ASK) modulation scheme. It takes a random digital signal, modulates it using ASK, and demodulates it back to recover the original information.**





#### **ðŸ“‹ Overview**



* **Modulation type: ASK (Amplitude Shift Keying)**



* **Sample Rate: 64k samples/sec**



* **Carrier Frequency: 8kHz**



* **Interpolation Factor: 64 (upsampling for smooth signal)**



* **Demodulation Technique: Coherent detection using cosine mixing and low-pass filtering**





####  **Block-by-Block Explanation**



**ðŸ”¹ 1. Random Source**



                           **Generates random integers \[0, 4)**



                            **Num Samples = 1024, repeated for continuous streaming**



**ðŸ”¹ 2. Chunks to Symbols**



                           **Maps the integers 0,1,2,3 to corresponding amplitudes using the symbol table: \[0, 1, 2, 3]**



                            **This forms the baseband signal before modulation**



**ðŸ”¹ 3. Throttle**



                            **Limits the rate to 64k samples/sec for real-time simulation**



**ðŸ”¹ 4. Interpolating FIR Filter**



                            **Interpolation factor = 64**



                           **Taps = numpy.full(interpolation\_factor, 1)**



                           **Purpose: Up sample the signal to match the carrier and avoid aliasing (acts like a "Repeat" block)**



**ðŸ”¹ 5. Virtual Sink / Source**



                           **Connects interpolated baseband signal to modulation stage via a virtual stream**



**ðŸ”¹ 6. Signal Source (Carrier Generator for Modulation)**



                           **Cosine wave at 8kHz, 64k sample rate**



                           **Acts as carrier signal for ASK modulation**



**ðŸ”¹ 7. Multiply (Modulator)**



                          **Multiplies baseband signal with carrier â†’ this creates ASK modulated signal**

**ðŸ”¸ 9. Signal Source (for Demodulation)**



                         **Two carriers: cosine and sine at 8kHz, for coherent demodulation (IQ)**



                         **Multiply with received signal to extract I (cos) and Q (sin) components**



**ðŸ”¸ 10. Multiply Blocks**



                         **One multiplies modulated signal Ã— cosine (I)**



                        **Another multiplies modulated signal Ã— sine (Q)**



**ðŸ”¸ 11. Low Pass Filters**



                       **Filters out high-frequency components (after mixing)**



                       **Cutoff frequency = 5kHz, Transition = 1kHz**



                       **Outputs: baseband I and Q signals**

#### **ðŸ§ª Technical Notes**



1. **Why interpolate? To up sample the baseband for smooth modulation at higher sample rates.**

2. **Why multiply by cos/sin in demodulation? Coherent detection requires mixing with original carrier.**

3. **Why Low Pass Filter? Removes double-frequency components, leaving baseband info**





#### **ðŸš€ How to Run**



1. **Open the .grc file in GNU Radio Companion.**

2. **Run the flowgraph.**

3. **Observe:

        Modulated ASK signal (QT Time Sink)

        Demodulated baseband signals (QT Time and Frequency Sinks)**

4. **Adjust parameters like carrier frequency or interpolation factor for experimentation.**

#### **ðŸ“‹Reasonings**





#####  **Multiply by âˆš2 Â· cos(wâ‚€t) and âˆš2 Â· sin(wâ‚€t) + LPF**



* **This is IQ demodulation or complex baseband conversion.**



* **What happens:**



                   **You create I (In-phase) and Q (Quadrature) components:**



                   **Multiply by âˆš2Â·cos(wâ‚€t) â†’ I**



                   **Multiply by âˆš2Â·sin(wâ‚€t) â†’ Q**



* **Then apply low-pass filters to both.**



* **Result: a complex baseband signal (I + jQ), which retains both amplitude and phase.**



**âœ… This is the correct method for general demodulation, especially if:**



                      **our signal is not purely real-valued modulation.**



                      **Weâ€™re working with FM, PSK, QAM, SSB, etc.**







##### **ðŸ”¹ Why Multiply by âˆš2?**





**This is for power normalization:**



                      **When you multiply a cosine by another cosine, the power scales down by half.**



                       **Multiplying by âˆš2 ensures the original signal power is preserved after demodulation.**



**But in GNU Radio, you often donâ€™t need to multiply by âˆš2 manually, because many blocks (like Multiply, Quadrature Demod, etc.) take care of scaling implicitly.**



**(You can see that I have multiplied the amplitude of cosine and sine signals by âˆš2 at signal source. If you wish you can keep the amplitude as one and increase the gain to two.)**





#### **ADDITIONAL NOTE ðŸ—’** 



#####  **Multiply by cosine only + low-pass filter**



**This is called coherent detection or real demodulation.**



**What happens:**



                      **You shift the bandpass signal down in frequency, but you only get part of the baseband signal (real part).**



                      **If your modulation is real-valued, like AM (Amplitude Modulation), this can be OK.**



                     **But if your modulation uses phase or quadrature info (e.g., QPSK, FM, SSB), this loses information.**

                        

                     **Suits only for REAL signals.**
